dog.txt is a space separated file containing float information for the "dogs" that Q1.py will be drawing.

Q1.py aims to read the space-separated dog.txt in order to draw "spinning" dogs around a circle centered at (30, 30) on the viewport which has a radius of 25. 
For each frame drawn (i.e. each iteration of the while loop) the dogs will be rotated one degree counterclockwise.

Q2.py aims to implement an algorithm provided by the professor in order to draw a dot plot on the screen. The file takes 3 command line inputs in order to help implement said algorithm. 
The file can be run with this command: "python3 Q2.py arg1 arg2 arg3"
arg1 is the integer for N in the algorithm (number of dots to draw), arg2 is the integer for the screen width, and arg3 is the integer for the height of the screen.

For very large integers for N (such as 5000000), the program can take a while to load. Give it a few seconds, it should still pop up however.
